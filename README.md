# Fullstack Project -- Booklist

The Plan:
The frontend is composed of a main page is where user can view and modify (add, delete, adjust priority, view book descriptions, etc.) their booklist.

The app backend runs on Node.js to respond to HTML requests.
MySQL is used as an interface with the database.
