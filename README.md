# Fullstack Project -- Booklist

The frontend will be composed of a main page and a login page. On the main page, user can view and modify their booklist -- search, add, delete, adjust priority, view book descriptions, etc. User can log into their account through the login page. There will also be an admin page where administrators may access and modify user accounts, as well as a registration page for new users.

The app backend will run on Node.js to respond to HTML requests.

MySQL or MongoDB will be used to interact with the database.
